Hi! I am a Senior Data Engineer for the [Center On Rural Innovation](https://ruralinnovation.us/) where I help data scientists and software engineers make sense of data and use it to help rural communities throughout America.

Previously, I worked as a geographer researching topics related to trees and the environmental, including studies on agroforestry, urban settings, virtual trees, tree identification applications and databases, etc. 

I hold a [Ph.D. in Geography and Environmental Studies](https://www.theses.fr/2017USPCC139) from the University of Paris.


Branch Twig Leaf is a blog exploring new approaches to spatial data as well as trees in digital humanities and social science research.
