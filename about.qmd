## About

I am a geographer: that means I care about spaces and places. I work on topics related to trees or environmental studies (trees in agroforestry, trees in urban settings, virtual trees, etc ...).  I have a PhD in Geography and Environmental studies ([here](https://www.theses.fr/2017USPCC139)) from the University of Paris.

This blog exists to help me remember and learn stuff.
