# Data products and more

A data product is a medium including data that is providing insights. The most common forms, in the wild, are reports, graphs, dashboards and web apps. 

I want to add to that list "packaged code" for data or "data as code". 

Usually data is files storing information, the most commun example is probably tabular data in spreadhseet (`.xls`) or plain text files (`.csv`) but it can also be provided from a database either directly or exposed throught an API. 

As writing API's call can be tedious (even with amazing generic packages!) we have seen some great specific package implementations: 

- tidycensus[^tidycensus] on top of the US Census Bureau API[^censusbureau]

- nasapoawer[^nasapower] on top of NASA POWER API client[^nasapowerapi]


[^tidycensus]: Walker K, Herman M (2025). *tidycensus: Load US Census Boundary and Attribute Data as 'tidyverse' and 'sf'-Ready Data Frames*. R package version 1.7.1, [https://walker-data.com/tidycensus/](https://walker-data.com/tidycensus/). 

[^censusbureau]: [https://www.census.gov/data/developers/about/terms-of-service.html](https://www.census.gov/data/developers/about/terms-of-service.html)

[^nasapower]: Sparks A (2018). “nasapower: A NASA POWER Global Meteorology, Surface Solar Energy and Climatology Data Client for R.” *The Journal of Open Source Software*, **3**(30), 1035. doi:10.21105/joss.01035. 

[^nasapowerapi]: [https://power.larc.nasa.gov/docs/services/api/](https://power.larc.nasa.gov/docs/services/api/)

Those packages are already "data as code": they allow you to seamlessly convert a lot operations in code and store them in plain text for version control and reproducibility. Sadly for reproducibility they are still depending on their upstream: if the US Census 

After this lenghty introduction I want to add a new way: wrapping around duckdb, parquet and object storage. So far I have seen few use of that tech stack.   

FCC introduction / analyst team 


ELT in `data_raw`

Easy access to documentation pkgdown, vignettes, or functions  


limits:  

still experimental duckdb 

how does it scales? 

analyst are not particuarly happy to write sql
