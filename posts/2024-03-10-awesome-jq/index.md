I wrote a blog post about using `jq` for filtering geojson. 


> If you are manipulating a lot of GeoJSON features/objects and want a quick CLI tool to filter and slice them, you should give jq a try! Since there are not many tutorials that exist on using jq to manage objects in the GeoJSON family, we hope that these few tricks will help you on your learning journey.
