For a consultancy business, it is good to have strong foundations in an established industry. It could be in both markets, but I guess it seems it is easier in a mature market thanks to “off-the-shelf solutions”.\nBoth markets were defined as:\n\nMature Market:\n\nStandardize: allow “off-the-shelf solutions”\n\nPresence of a robust consultancy ecosystem (with competition)\n\nInformed consumers\n\n\n\nLess Mature Market:\n\nProblems are still unclear\n\nNeed for more custom development / more IT\nMore constraints from the environment (ex: low bandwidth)\nNeed to build a common language\n\nThe best way to build a strong core is to practice and build experience."

You need to maintain your core area of expertise while also being curious about new opportunities.\nAccording to Todd Slind, a great consultant should have:\n- Curiosity/creativity as a self-starter\n- Can “interface” with clients (importance of speaking the same language)\n- Is able to have ownership over their own personal development\nIf a consultant wants to bring new ideas/new technology to improve a process, it is better if they can bring some prototype or find a way to show how it can be “real”. I should print this advice: it is easy to see all the new shiny developments (sedona, arrow) but the better question is “where and how to apply them to solve problems?”\nI also liked the idea for consultants to socialize and create discussion spaces dedicated to estimating the time needed for different assignments.\nStrangely, technology was not brought into the discussion too much (ie: impact of choosing one, “one-way door versus two-way doors”) and I hope this can be a topic for another episode!!!"

I also know a lot of smart people that are learning Rust and improving their programming skill because they are learning new ways and new perspective on programming.\nI guess you could say that, at the end, “senior” people know that using just Python/SQL/Excel is the best way to maximize their ROI. It is probably correct but I think a “senior” or a smart guy is someone that can identify the right tool to solve a problem (and not necessarily using the “second best one”) and to do that they probably learned by experimenting with other tools."
