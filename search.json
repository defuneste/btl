This is more simple that it looks: we have an Uniform Resource Name from OGC that defines a feature in istSOS (the service we will use) version 1.0. This feature is a point and has the name (identifier) of Berthelot. Now we would like to collect observations about noise here. To do that, we will use a procedure : a way to collect observations. The procedure has a location (coordinates with a coordinate reference system) Here this is done with one sensor but it can be done with more than one or/and using some processes. Our FOI have the procedure/sensor AF01 associated (urn:ogc:def:procedure:x-istsos:1.0:AF01). It is monitoring at least one observed property (observedProperty). AF01 produce 4 of them (lday, levening, lnight). lday is a noise level, taking into account human ears in decibels, calculated during daylight hours (6am-6pm). Eventually we will get a result, let’s say 62.8 dB(A). dB(A) is our unit of measure (uom). Time is usually expressed in ISO 8601 (2021-02-06T06:00:00.000000Z).\nTogether, all of the above make an observation!\nFinally, offering enables you to make some logical grouping of observations."

    "text": "Making use of what we learn\nThe schema below is adapted from the OGC documentation (p. 14 and 15). It shows the different steps required to collect data with an associate request. First, we need to know what kind of services are available.\n\nThis a job for a GetCapabilities request:\nhttps://download.data.grandlyon.com/sos/bruit?service=SOS&request=GetCapabilities\nThe first part is the address: https://download.data.grandlyon.com/sos/bruit\n(bruit means ‘noise’ in French)\nThen, after ? we start the request specifying the service and the request. With this request we get an XML giving us all of the information about the service and what we can do with it. A quick scroll gives us the name of the procedures we can request information from and the output format provided.\nWe can now ask for more information about the sensor with DescribeSensor before getting observations.\nhttps://download.data.grandlyon.com/sos/bruit?request=DescribeSensor&procedure=AF01&outputFormat=text%2Fxml%3Bsubtype%3D%22sensorML%2F1.0.1%22&service=SOS&version=1.0.0\nThis one looks a bit more complicated, so let’s examine it. We will still use the same address. Then, we will request DescribeSensor and we will ask for the only output format available: text/xml;subtype=\"sensorML/1.0.1\". It looks a bit complicated, because some characters need to be escaped (outputFormat=text%2Fxml%3Bsubtype%3D%22sensorML%2F1.0.1%22). The last part is just asking for SOS version 1.0.\nThis request allows us to check the AllowedTimes for our next request : GetObservation.\nhttps://download.data.grandlyon.com/sos/bruit?service=SOS&version=1.0.0&request=GetObservation&offering=observatoire_acoustique_grandlyon&procedure=AF01&eventTime=2010-06-17T08:00:00+02:00/2021-01-23T07:00:00+01:00&observedProperty=lday&responseFormat=text/plain\nOk this result is HUGE! However, we have already built some understanding and I will explain the part that we haven’t seen yet. In SOS version 1.0, we need to specify the offering that groups our sensor (offering=observatoire_acoustique_grandlyon).\nThis information comes from the GetCapabilities. Then, we define our procedure and set up a time interval of interest (eventTime=2010-06-17T08:00:00+02:00/2021-01-23T07:00:00+01:00).\nAfter that, we specify the observed property that we’re interested in (observedProperty=lday) and response format (responseFormat=text/plain). Just as before, these two pieces of insight come from the GetCapabilities. As you may have noticed, we don’t need to add all observed property and procedure definitions, just the identifier is fine (lday vs urn:ogc:def:parameter:::noise:lday).\nMuch more can and should be said (you can use bbox or aggregate in requests!) but let’s stop here. I hope that we can explore some ways to interact with http requests in R, soon!\n\naf01 &lt;- read.csv(\"bruit.csv\", header = FALSE)\naf01$V1 &lt;- lubridate::as_datetime(af01$V1)\nnames(af01) &lt;- c(\"time\", \"sensor\", \"lday\")\nquickplot &lt;- ggplot2::ggplot(data = af01, ggplot2::aes( x =  time, y = lday)) +\n                ggplot2::geom_point(alpha = .1, col = \"darkred\") + \n                ggplot2::ylim(c(50, 90)) +\n                ggplot2::theme_bw()\nquickplot"

    "text": "Recently, someone posted a question on Linkedin about sampling along some lines. It may not be obvious for everyone why anyone would like to do that so let’s provide some examples: sampling in a river every N meters, sampling species diversity along transects. The lines or segments can be used as a way to measure some kind of gradient or to follow something that can be represented as a line. A line is just a one-dimensional (1D) representation, so even if we use it in space it can represent way more stuff… like time!\nThe question had to do with QGIS and Postgis. I was a bit curious about how to do it in R and also wanted try with QGIS (later!). I used rocker/geospatial:4.0.4 with sf (0.9.0) and spastat (1.63-3) packages (and their respective dependencies). My exploration went a bit longer than expected, so I will just start with spastat then keep going."

Let’s try it!\nThe first line just creates some lines (“randomly”). The only difficulty is the psp function. This function creates an object of class psp or a line segment pattern. Spatstat uses its own objects and methods but it is easy to convert them as you can see in the second line where the sf package is used to write our dear friend shapefile. I commented the line because I didn’t want to run a new set of lines every time.\n\nsome_lines &lt;- spatstat.geom::psp(runif(20), runif(20), runif(20), runif(20),  window = spatstat.geom::owin()) \n# sf::st_write(sf::st_as_sf(some_lines)[-1,], \"some_lines.shp\")\nlines &lt;- sf::st_read(\"some_lines.shp\")\n\nReading layer `some_lines' from data source \n  `/Users/olivierleroy/Documents/btl/posts/2021-03-01-sampling-allong-a-line/some_lines.shp' \n  using driver `ESRI Shapefile'\nSimple feature collection with 20 features and 1 field\nGeometry type: LINESTRING\nDimension:     XY\nBounding box:  xmin: 0.02009798 ymin: 0.03753605 xmax: 0.9965629 ymax: 0.9619593\nCRS:           NA\n\n\n\n#\\ label: reading them back \nsome_lines &lt;- spatstat.geom::as.psp(sf::st_geometry(lines), window = owin()) #  read them back\nplot(some_lines, main = \"Draw some lines\", col = \"grey\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI admit that indexing with negative 1 ([-1,]) is a bit ugly, but if you want to use the almighty shapefile you can only use one type of geometry (no one is perfect!). That’s why you have to remove the polygon that is the bbox at the first line (or use some more hipster geo format). Finally, in the third line, we read it back. Spatstat works primarily in projected coordinates and this should be kept in mind (we don’t care too much about our lack of CRS here, which would not be the case in a real-world project which could fail if you use geographic coordinate systems).\nNow we can use the pointsOnLines function to create an object of ppp type (AKA points pattern) and plot the points. We just use two arguments, the first one is our lines and the second eps is Spacing between successive points. As stated in the details section of the documentation the spacing of eps is measured in coordinate units of X”. Here we used some numbers (20) from a uniform distribution with the default arguments (min = 0 and max = 1) so eps = 0.1 was fine. I also liked to shortok default argument so I didn’t change it.\n\nsampling_points &lt;- spatstat.geom::pointsOnLines(some_lines, eps = 0.1)\nplot(some_lines, main=\"Add points!\", col = \"grey\")\nplot(sampling_points, add = TRUE, pch = \"+\", col = \"darkred\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsf::st_write(sf::st_as_sf(sampling_points)[-1,], \"sampling_points.shp\") # save them"

This is trickier than it looks: what happens when the length of a lines is not a multiple of our spacing value?

We expected 3 samples but we got 4 and it looks like the first sample, on both sides, is located at 1 m from the end/beginning of the line (in a circular line they will be 2 m apart) but something is staring to be problematic : the only spacing of 3 is between the second and third sample, other spacing is 2.5 m. If we take a longer line (25 m like below) we get the same pattern (1m, 2.5m then 3) but with more samples spaced with 3 m.\n\nfenetre &lt;- spatstat.geom::owin(xrange=c(-1,26), yrange=c(0,2)) # define a reusable windows \nline &lt;- spatstat.geom::psp(0, 1, 25, 1,  window = fenetre)     # one line length = 10\nguide &lt;- spatstat.geom::ppp(0:25, rep(1,26), window = fenetre) # create some guides\nsamples &lt;- spatstat.geom::pointsOnLines(line, eps = 3)         # spacing of 3\nplot(line, col = \"grey\", main = \"\")                       # plot everything \nplot(guide, pch = \"|\", add = TRUE)\nplot(samples, pch = 16, col = \"darkred\", add = TRUE)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s dive into the code (thx open source!). I will skip the part that defines the function, check what arguments are used, etc.. and do a first stop at L25-L32. This part is the code for what should be done if we have too lines that are too small (length &lt;= spacing) and shortok == TRUE (our setup). We can see that with this option, a sample point will be added at the middle of our small line.\nI will then move to the part for every other (i.e., non-small) line. We can also skip the loop and the bind part and just try with one line. Below I have just reproduced L36 and 47 :\n\n# re using same example \nfenetre &lt;- spatstat.geom::owin(xrange=c(-1,11), yrange=c(0,2))\nline &lt;- spatstat.geom::psp(0, 1, 10, 1,  window = fenetre) \nlinedf    &lt;- as.data.frame(line)\neps &lt;- 3                                    # some spacing\n\nleni &lt;- spatstat.geom::lengths_psp(line)    # length of the segment : 10 \nnwhole &lt;- floor(leni/eps)                   # how many whole segments can we fit : 3\nif(leni/eps - nwhole &lt; 0.5 && nwhole &gt; 2)   # if we do 3 nwhole we have some \"leftovers\"\n    nwhole &lt;- nwhole - 1                    # I guess it is a design choice \nrump &lt;- (leni - nwhole * eps)/2             # \nbrks &lt;- c(0, rump + (0:nwhole) * eps, leni) # making bricks: 0 2 5 8 10\nnbrks &lt;- length(brks)                       # how many bricks: 5\n# points at middle of each piece\nss &lt;- (brks[-1] + brks[-nbrks])/2\ntp &lt;- ss/leni                               # make it relative\nx &lt;- with(linedf, x0 + tp * (x1-x0))        # give them coordinates\ny &lt;- with(linedf, y0 + tp * (y1-y0))\n\nThe authors have made some design choices. Instead of going for 3 points, they have gone with 4 and focused on their definition : “Given a line segment pattern, place a series of points at equal distances along each line segment.”. Points are not located at every x spacing but instead at equal distances: if we set 3 points they are not at the same distance anymore, so it seems they opted to make a compromise, as when (L9) adds a point and decreases the spacing a bit and when not doing so. I feel this is a correct choice when sampling and it remind me a lot of reflections about the all block quadra variance family and the importance of the starting point."

As the title states, the show addresses both the business and career aspect of geoconsulting.\nBefore going into these two aspects, I would like to thank Locana for sponsoring the podcast and contributing to the geospatial community. I am also following Geospatial Connections with another Locana employe and I feel those contributions are great!"

    "text": "Geospatial Consulting as Business\n\n“We do not want to be on the bleeding edge […] where we are doing all the bleeding […].” Todd Slind\n\nA lot of the exchange was around the need for a consulting business (and as we will see later how it applies to individuals) to strike a balance between having a strong core or area of expertise while also placing some bets in other sectors.\nThis dichotomy can also be seen in the “mature market” versus “less mature market”. For a consultancy business, it is good to have strong foundations in an established industry. It could be in both markets, but I guess it seems it is easier in a mature market thanks to “off-the-shelf solutions”.\nBoth markets were defined as:\n\nMature Market:\n\nStandardize: allow “off-the-shelf solutions”\n\nPresence of a robust consultancy ecosystem (with competition)\n\nInformed consumers\n\n\n\nLess Mature Market:\n\nProblems are still unclear\n\nNeed for more custom development / more IT\nMore constraints from the environment (ex: low bandwidth)\nNeed to build a common language\n\nThe best way to build a strong core is to practice and build experience."

    "text": "Geospatail consulting as a career\nThis leads, at the consultant level, to a trade off between “learning on the job” versus “being in your comfort zone”. You need to maintain your core area of expertise while also being curious about new opportunities.\nAccording to Todd Slind, a great consultant should have:\n- Curiosity/creativity as a self-starter\n- Can “interface” with clients (importance of speaking the same language)\n- Is able to have ownership over their own personal development\nIf a consultant wants to bring new ideas/new technology to improve a process, it is better if they can bring some prototype or find a way to show how it can be “real”. I should print this advice: it is easy to see all the new shiny developments (sedona, arrow) but the better question is “where and how to apply them to solve problems?”\nI also liked the idea for consultants to socialize and create discussion spaces dedicated to estimating the time needed for different assignments.\nStrangely, technology was not brought into the discussion too much (ie: impact of choosing one, “one-way door versus two-way doors”) and I hope this can be a topic for another episode!!!"

In my case learning a bit of C/C++ will be very helpful because lots of dependencies, I used is in this language (and yes sometimes to solve some issue you need to go that far). I also know a lot of smart people that are learning Rust and improving their programming skill because they are learning new ways and new perspective on programming.\nI guess you could say that, at the end, “senior” people know that using just Python/SQL/Excel is the best way to maximize their ROI. It is probably correct but I think a “senior” or a smart guy is someone that can identify the right tool to solve a problem (and not necessarily using the “second best one”) and to do that they probably learned by experimenting with other tools."
