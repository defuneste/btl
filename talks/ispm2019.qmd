ISPM is the **International Society on Participatory Mapping** I presented at their second conference (June 19th, 2019) with  Pierre-Yves Gicquel and [Thierry Joliveau](https://mondegeonumerique.wordpress.com/qui/) in Espoo, Finland.  

The talk focus:

-  the new landscape, at the time, on crowdsourced naturalist and tree inventories, 

- using OpenStreetMap for urban and/or isolated tree instead of creating a silo 

- how gamification with the help of incorporated botanic tools could improve data quality.
