ISPM is the **International Society on Participatory Mapping** I presented at their second conference (June 19th, 2019) with  Pierre-Yves Gicquel and [Thierry Joliveau](https://mondegeonumerique.wordpress.com/qui/) in Espoo, Finland.  

The talk focus on the new landscape, at the time, on crowdsourced naturalist and tree inventories, why for urban and/or isolated tree they should use OpenStreetMap and how gamification with the help of incorpored botanic tools could improved data quality. 

Our presentation is available [HERE](https://codeberg.org/defuneste/presentations/src/branch/main/ISPM_albiziapp_2019/ISPM_albiziapp.pdf) in pdf!
