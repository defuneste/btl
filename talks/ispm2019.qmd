I presented a lecture at the second **International Society on Participatory Mapping** (ISPM, https://pmappingsociety.mn.co/) Conference (June 19th, 2019) with Pierre-Yves Gicquel and [Thierry Joliveau](https://mondegeonumerique.wordpress.com/qui/) in Espoo, Finland.  

The talk focused on:

- The new digital landscape for crowdsourced naturalist and tree inventories

- Using OpenStreetMap for urban and/or isolated trees to counter data silos

- How gamification that incorporates botanic tools can improve data quality
